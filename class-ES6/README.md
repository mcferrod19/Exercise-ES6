#### Exercise
##### 1er part

Let's model a class that represents an HTML button. The class has several attributes:

     ·The HTML element of the DOM
     ·Button text
     ·A button icon

The class has a render method that paints the text and icon in the HTML button. We create an instance and execute its render method to see how it works

##### 2nd Part

Let's model a class for red buttons that inherits from the previous one. Your render method must paint the contents of the red button (text and icon) We create an instance of the new class and call render to prove that it works correctly

##### 3rd Part

Let's create a setter for the content of the button, which in addition to updating the button text calls the render method to be painted automatically

     The setter we can use it from
      ·The button builder method
      ·The button instance
